## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joaquim Lucas Pessoa da Silva. I am a Computer Science student at FAESA University Center.

In my academic career, I work as a monitor for subjects related to programming labs.

Actually, I'm learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

While I'm not occupied with some students in monitoring sessions, I'll share some stuff related to my studies and practices.

If you want to contact me, feel free to send an e-mail to joaquim.pessoa@tutamail.com or send a message for me in personal LinkedIn profile, www.linkedin.com/in/joaquim-lucas-pessoa-da-silva-bb8485256.
